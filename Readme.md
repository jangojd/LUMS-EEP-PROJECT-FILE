Equity Equation Project (Quantitative Study - ML)

Overview

The Equity Equation Project is a quantitative study leveraging Machine Learning (ML) to analyze education access for students aged 5-15 years in Lahore Division, Pakistan. Using data from the Pakistan Standard Living Measurement (PSLM) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), we aim to identify key indicators and variables influencing access to education.

Objectives
Merge PSLM and MICS Data Using STATA

Analyze PSLM and MICS data for Lahore Division.

Identify factors influencing education accessibility.

Develop Machine Learning models to determine the most significant variables affecting education access.

Provide insights to policymakers for improving educational equity.
